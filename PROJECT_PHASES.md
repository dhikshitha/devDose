- **Security**: Security audit after Phase 1, 4, and 7

### User Experience Risks
- **Feature Overload**: Gradual feature introduction
- **Learning Curve**: Comprehensive onboarding per phase
- **Performance**: Performance budget per phase

### Business Risks
- **User Retention**: Analytics from Phase 1
- **Content Quality**: Review system from Phase 2
- **Monetization**: Consider premium features in Phase 6+
